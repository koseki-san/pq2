# Pq2

Priority Queue implementation using Heap.

## Usage

### Scalar

```ruby
pq = Pq2.new
pq.push(2)
pq.push(1)
pq.push(3)

pq.pop
# => 1
pq.first
# => 2
pq.pop
# => 2
pq.pop
# => 3

pq.empty?
# => true
```

### Comparable

```ruby
emails = [
  Email.new('a@github.com'),
  Email.new('a@example.com'),
  Email.new('b@github.com'),
  Email.new('b@example.com'),
]
pq = Pq2.new(emails)
pq.pop
# => 'a@example.com'
pq.pop
# => 'b@example.com'
pq.pop
# => 'a@github.com'
pg.pop
# => 'b@github.com'

class Email
  include Comparable

  attr_reader :domain, :local

  def initialize(email)
    @local, @domain = email.split(?@)
  end

  def <=>(other)
    order = domain <=> other.domain
    return order unless order == 0
    local <=> other.domain
  end
end
```
